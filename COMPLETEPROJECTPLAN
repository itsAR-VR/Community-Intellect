# **B2B CMO Club Internal Community AI**

## **Feature Plan \+ Priority Backlog (P0–P3) — v2 (AI‑First, Intake‑Driven, Internal‑Only)**

**This document is the build‑ready feature plan for the B2B CMO Club Internal Community AI.**

---

## **1\) Executive summary**

### **1.1 What we are building**

An internal‑only **Retention Intelligence \+ Concierge Enablement Engine** that powers the B2B CMO Club’s “white‑glove concierge” experience at **fixed cost** (one community manager).

This AI will:

* Maintain a continuously updated, evidence‑backed “truth profile” for every member.  
* Detect opportunities and risks using **two engines**:  
  1. **Live signals** (Slack \+ LinkedIn \+ careers pages)  
  2. **Forced‑success signals** (intake \+ surveys \+ mastermind calls \+ internal knowledge) surveys sent via slack (we can use our own platform and have a public endpoint for surveys)  
* Convert signals into **ranked actions** (primarily drafted Slack DMs from the Community Manager account).  
* Run a weekly “value guarantee” system (minimum one value drop/member/week).  
* Enable programming (masterminds \+ workshops \+ speakers) using data intersections across members.

### **1.2 Why this will be good**

B2B’s AI will perform well because the club is structurally designed for AI performance:

* **Complete intake completeness** via the closer intake call (high‑integrity structured data).  
* **Identity stitching solved upfront** (emails used for Slack/Zoom/etc.).  
* **Internal‑only action cockpit \+ auto‑send logic** (CM efficiency).  
* **Weekly forced‑success engine** (not monthly).  
* **LinkedIn \+ careers page live signals** on a scheduled 12‑hour loop.  
* **Hard outcome loops** (1–10 ratings \+ feedback \<6) to train the system over time.

---

## **2\) Core objective and KPI contract**

### **2.1 Core objective (non‑negotiable)**

The AI’s job is **not just support**. It is a **Retention Intelligence \+ Concierge Enablement Engine**.

### **2.2 Primary KPIs the AI must influence**

* Renewal rate  
* Expansion/adoption (Slack, masterminds, workshops; app later if ever)  
* Time‑to‑value for new members  
* Perceived “they really know me” factor  
* Value delivered to members (wins, intros, savings, solved problems)

---

## **3\) Phase 1 scope constraints (locked decisions)**

### **3.1 AI is internal‑only (Phase 1\)**

* No member‑facing chatbot yet.  
* Community team uses:  
  * Dashboard (Next.js/Vercel)  
  * Internal AI chat inside dashboard  
  * Slack admin notifications

### **3.2 Messaging mechanics (Slack)**

* Proactive outreach goes out as the **Community Manager’s Slack account**, AI drafted.  
* Auto‑send is allowed **for any outreach type** (intros/perks/resources/invites/check‑ins) **only when**:  
  1. The member replied to the last CM message **or** the previous conversation is marked “closed”, and  
  2. **24+ hours** have passed since the last message in that DM thread.  
* No hard “max DM frequency”—the response‑gating prevents double‑sending and spam.

### **3.3 Forced success cadence (weekly)**

* Minimum **one value drop per member per week**  
* Preferred forced‑success order:  
  1. Intros  
  2. Perks  
  3. Resources  
  4. Workshop invite  
  5. Check‑in question

### **3.4 Masterminds and workshops cadence**

* Masterminds: **1 mastermind per \~5 members**, self‑hosted; AI suggests intersection topics. (Group stability policy remains: group stays the same; members can request changes.)  
* Workshops/speaker events: **2–4 per month** (bi‑weekly to weekly).

### **3.5 Transcript provider and canonical system**

* Transcripts: Recall.ai (via custom tool)  
* Canonical CRM/source of truth: Supabase \+ Prisma  
* Membership/payments: Supabase \+ Stripe integration

---

## **4\) Data sources & ingestion spec (what the AI learns from)**

### **4.1 Structured “truth sources” (highest priority)**

These are the sources designed to minimize hallucinations:

1. Closer intake call recording \+ transcript (deep capture)  
2. Intake structured form/fields (completed during/after call)  
3. Member profile confirmation message (“what’s wrong/missing?”) — creates verified facts  
4. Surveys (monthly/quarterly refresh, as defined below) survey sent via slack (we can use our own platform and have a public endpoint for surveys)

### **4.2 Ongoing internal signals**

5. Slack channels (messages, threads, reactions)

**Slack channel structure (AI signal design)**

* **Core channels (auto-join / Tier 1):**  
  * \#announcements (read-only updates)  
  * \#introductions (templated intro required)  
  * \#wins (pinned template/instructions for wins; speaker sourcing)   
  * \#asks (pinned template/instructions for asks; highest-signal requests)  
  * \#problem-solving (tactical help / troubleshooting)  
  * \#tech-stack (tools; perks matching)  
  * \#marketing-tactics (general tactics \+ discussion)  
  * \#hiring-and-people (hiring, team, operators)  
  * \#partnership-opportunities (co-marketing/JVs)  
  * \#perks (perk hub \+ new perk notifications)  
  * \#market-signals (curated weekly prompts/signals)  
  * \#build-in-public (experiments \+ learnings)  
  * \#general (light; discourage tactical asks here)  
  * \#cold-email, \#cold-text, \#seo, \#ppc, \#social-media-management, \#social-media-advertising, etc.  
  * \#mastermind- (self-hosted; \~5 members)  
  * \#velocity (high-standards program)

Slack ingestion must capture messages, threads, and reactions across these channels (respecting membership and privacy rules).

6. Mastermind calls (single main room; whole transcript usable)  
7. Accountability pod posts (monthly goals \+ receipts)  
8. CourseCreator360 / internal knowledge corpus

---

## **4.3 Live external signals (12-hour cadence)**

**Goal:** capture high-value external signals without ingesting excessive content.

In addition to LinkedIn and company careers pages, the AI will also monitor:

* **Instagram (company \+ personal profiles)**  
* **Indeed (job postings and role changes)**  
* **X (Twitter) profiles (company \+ personal)**

All external signals are **public-only** and do **not** require member logins.

---

### **4.3.1 LinkedIn monitoring targets (public-only)**

* Member personal posts (public)  
* Company page posts (public)  
* Job changes (when observable from public profile deltas or announcements)  
* Hiring announcements (LinkedIn job posts if public, plus company careers page changes)

No logins are required from members (public signal collection only).

---

### **4.3.2 Instagram monitoring targets (public-only)**

* Company Instagram posts and bio changes  
* Member personal Instagram posts (if public and provided at intake)  
* Signals such as:  
  * product or campaign launches  
  * brand repositioning  
  * hiring announcements  
  * major engagement spikes  
  * link-in-bio or CTA changes

---

### **4.3.3 Indeed monitoring targets (public-only)**

* New job postings associated with the member’s company  
* Changes in role types or hiring volume over time  
* Signals such as:  
  * team expansion  
  * function prioritization (e.g., lifecycle, RevOps, paid media)  
  * mismatch between stated goals and hiring behavior

---

### **4.3.4 X (Twitter) monitoring targets (public-only)**

* Member personal X profile activity (if public and provided)  
* Company X profile activity  
* Signals such as:  
  * strategic opinions or market commentary  
  * expressed frustration or urgency  
  * reactions to competitors or industry changes  
  * early signals of experimentation or pivots

---

### **4.3.5 Careers page monitoring**

* For each member company, store a canonical careers page URL at intake (or derive from company site)  
* Monitor for changes and new job postings  
* Treat the most recent changes as highest value

---

### **4.3.6 “Post analysis” summarization layer (anti-bloat)**

For every detected LinkedIn, Instagram, Indeed, X, or careers-page item:

Run a lightweight analysis prompt to extract:

* **“What happened?”** (one sentence)  
* **Tags** (hiring, launch, pivot, messaging, product update, funding, partnership, thought leadership)  
* **Implied needs/opportunities**  
* **Recommended action type(s)** (intro / perk / resource / workshop invite / check-in)

Store:

* Link to original source  
* Timestamp  
* Structured summary \+ tags (not full raw content unless needed for audit)

Add the summary into the member’s context feed.

---

## **5\) System architecture (internal components)**

### **5.1 Canonical “Truth Graph” (Supabase \+ Prisma)**

The AI is built on a member truth graph:

* **Facts**: goals, bottlenecks, stack tools, constraints, initiatives, hiring plans, expertise  
* **Signals**: Slack events, call highlights, LinkedIn/careers summaries  
* **Actions**: recommendations, message drafts, intros, perk sends  
* **Outcomes**: 1–10 ratings \+ conditional feedback (\<6) \+ escalation

Every fact must have provenance:

* source\_type (intake, survey, slack, mastermind, linkedin, careers)  
* source\_id (call id, slack message id, linkedin signal id)  
* timestamp  
* confidence

### **5.2 Opportunity pipeline (“Signal → Action”)**

All incoming data becomes standardized **Opportunity Items**:

* type: hiring, pain signal, win, topic trend, tool mention, partnership request, etc.  
* urgency score  
* relevance to member’s goals  
* recommended next actions

Opportunity Items are converted into:

* recommendations  
* message drafts  
* tasks in the dashboard queues

### **5.3 Concierge Command Center (dashboard)**

The dashboard is the operating surface for one CM:

* Member profile view (“truth profile \+ current context \+ actions”)  
* Who needs attention list  
* Opportunity feed  
* Draft messages queue (manual send / approve auto-send)  
* Intros queue \+ outcomes  
* Perks queue \+ outcomes  
* Weekly forced-success queue  
* Programming planner (masterminds \+ workshop topics \+ speakers)

### **5.4 Internal AI Chat (in-dashboard)**

The CM/founders can ask:

* “Who should I talk to this week?”  
* “What matters to \[Member\] right now?”  
* “Draft a DM to \[Member\] about \[X\] using evidence.”  
* “Which 5 members should be spotlighted for a workshop on \[topic\]?”

---

# **6\) Feature plan \+ priority backlog (P0–P3)**

**Note on priorities:** The Sora Media AI spec is largely P0 in spirit (core concierge \+ retention engine). B2B keeps those as P0 and adds additional P0 items enabled by high-quality intake and the club’s AI-first design.

---

## **P0 — Launch-critical (must ship before public scale)**

### **P0.0 Intake Completeness \+ Identity Stitching (the B2B advantage)**

**What:** a structured intake system that produces verified, high-integrity member data so the AI can be precise from Day 1\.

**Includes:**

* **Closer intake call script \+ structured form** (goals, bottlenecks, constraints, stack by category, hiring plans, expertise, preferences).  
* **Completeness gate:** a member cannot be marked “Active” until required fields are captured.  
* **Identity stitching:** capture and link all identities at intake:  
  * primary email  
  * secondary email(s)  
  * Slack email (if different)  
  * Zoom email (if different)  
  * assistant/EA email (optional)  
* **Member verification loop:** after intake, send “Member Truth Profile v1” for corrections; store edits as verified facts.

**Outputs:**

* verified Member Truth Profile (with provenance)  
* stable identity mapping (Slack user ↔ member)

**Acceptance criteria:**

* intake completeness is enforced programmatically (no “best effort”); missing required fields block onboarding automations  
* member corrections update the truth graph and reduce future wrong recommendations

---

### **P0.1 Truth Graph \+ Provenance Storage (Supabase/Prisma)**

**Acceptance:** intake calls reliably produce structured facts; masterminds generate topic signals.

---

### **P0.4 Ingestion: Surveys (refresh engine)**

**What:** scheduled surveys that update truth facts (goals, stack changes, hiring plans).  
**Cadence:** monthly “quick refresh” \+ quarterly “deep refresh” (implementation detail).  
**Acceptance:** survey updates create new fact versions with timestamps; old facts remain viewable.

surveys sent via slack (we can use our own platform and have a public endpoint for surveys)

---

### **P0.5 Ingestion: Knowledge corpus (CourseCreator360 \+ club policies)**

**What:** index internal knowledge for retrieval and recommendation.  
**Acceptance:** AI can attach 1–3 relevant resources to a member’s current bottleneck.

---

## **9\) Implementation phases (aligned to Feb 15 target)**

From ZRG timeline: B2BCMO Club Community AI completion target \= **Feb 15**.

### **Phase 1 (ship by Feb 15\) — “Concierge Core \+ Live signals \+ Weekly value”**

Deliver:

* P0 features 0.1–0.20 (above), with working dashboard and auto-send gating  
* Working LinkedIn/careers connector layer (public signals \+ 12-hour schedule)  
* Working weekly forced-success queue \+ delivery logic

### **Phase 2 (post‑Feb 15\) — “Retention proof \+ advanced programming”**

Deliver:

* Progress & narrative builder  
* market signals curation  
* velocity ops support  
* segmentation improvements

---

## **10\) Known risks & mitigation (kept inside the plan)**

1. **Public-only LinkedIn may not expose everything** (job changes/hiring signals may be incomplete).  
   *Mitigation:* combine LinkedIn with company careers pages; treat missing data as “unknown” and rely on intake/surveys.  
2. **Mastermind scaling at 1 per 5 members** can create many groups quickly.  
   *Mitigation:* automate group creation, leader rotation, and agenda intersection suggestions.  
3. **No max DM frequency** can still feel spammy if a member replies frequently.  
   *Mitigation:* impact scoring \+ merge drafts \+ allow CM per-member mute/throttle toggle if needed.  
4. **Outcome loops increase operational overhead**  
   *Mitigation:* automate outcome requests and only escalate to CM when rating \<6 or negative sentiment.

##Additional info
Key product/ops constraints (B2B CMO Club)
AI is internal-only in Phase 1 (community team uses dashboard + internal chat; no member-facing bot yet).
Messaging is sent via the Community Manager + AI SlackBot Slack account (AI drafts; dashboard can auto-send under strict gating).
Auto-send eligibility rule: only send after the member has replied (or the conversation is marked closed) AND 24+ hours have passed since the last message in that DM thread. 
Forced-success cadence: minimum one value drop per member per week to them directly (things like perks channel and market insights that go to everyone dont count towards this weekly minimum); priority order: Intros to other members (CM) → Perks (AI) → Resources (AI) → Workshop invite (AI) → Check-in question (CM). (Others to add: tagging relevant members in thread from (CM) in the main group that pertains to the members current needs.)
2 types of value drops: 1. Forced 1 per week, 2. Trigger-Based.
LinkedIn monitoring cadence: every 12 hours per member; store summarized analysis (not full content dumps).
External signals: LinkedIn personal posts + company page posts + job changes + hiring announcements, plus company careers page monitoring. Add indeed jobs posted members' Instagram. X profile.
Mastermind groups: Community Manager creates groups and channels; AI suggests groupings (target ~1 mastermind per 5 members) AND AGENDA FOR THE Month FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY (every month to start, the AI should take what is most pertinent and being talked about the most within the community channels and hot topics online and make an agenda for every single mastermind group to use right before the next mastermind happens and forward such to them with instructions on what the next mastermind will be about and how to run it - one agenda for the entire community and all masterminds). Every year they get assigned a new group unless they want to stay in the group or switch.
Workshops: 1-2 per month required at launch (owned and scheduled by Teddy/Rayne/Hugh).
